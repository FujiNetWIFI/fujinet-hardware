# RS232 FujiNet Rev00A

This is a prototype RS232 FujiNet device. Hardware design is provided as-is / untested.

## Rev00A Update

Rev00A is a modification of the [RS232-Rev00](../RS232-Rev00) board.  This model replaces the TRS3238E level-shifter that has been difficult to stock at the typical PCB fabricators with a functionally equivalent [MaxLinear SP3238EEA-L](https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/RS232-ICs_MaxLinear-SP3238EEA-L-TR_C49669.html).  

PCB design files are in DipTrace v5 format.
