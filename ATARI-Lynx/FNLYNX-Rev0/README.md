# ATARI LYNX FujiNet Revision 0

This public release of FujiNet hardware is open source hardware licensed under CERN OHL 2.0.

# Notes

These design files should be considered for prototypes only and not a production device. Three PCBs were made of this prototype and did work, however, they have not been completely tested. Firmware can be built for the Lynx FujiNet from the [FujiNet-PlatformIO repository](https://github.com/FujiNetWiFi/fujinet-platformio).
