This public release of FujiNet hardware is open source hardware licensed under CERN OHL 2.0.

# Notes

This FujiNet for Atari Lynx can be built with minimal parts for experimentation and uses the ESP32-DEVKITC-VE board. The only other parts needed are a resistor and a 3 pole 1/8" TRS plug/cable. Firmware can be built for the Lynx FujiNet from the [FujiNet-PlatformIO repository](https://github.com/FujiNetWiFi/fujinet-platformio).
